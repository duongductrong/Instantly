## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` description first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
   - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT AGENT ROUTING (STEP 2 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before responding to ANY request, automatically analyze and select the best agent(s).**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow the protocol defined in `@[skills/intelligent-routing]`.

### Auto-Selection Protocol

1. **Analyze (Silent)**: Detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security, etc.) from user request.
2. **Select Agent(s)**: Choose the most appropriate specialist(s).
3. **Inform User**: Concisely state which expertise is being applied.
4. **Apply**: Generate response using the selected agent's persona and rules.

### Response Format (MANDATORY)

When auto-applying an agent, inform the user:

```markdown
🤖 **Applying knowledge of `@[agent-name]`...**
📚 **Skills:** `skill-1`, `skill-2`, `skill-3`

[Continue with specialized response]
```

**Rules:**

1. **Silent Analysis**: No verbose meta-commentary ("I am analyzing...").
2. **Respect Overrides**: If user mentions `@agent`, use it.
<!-- 3. **Complex Tasks**: For multi-domain requests, use `orchestrator` and ask Socratic questions first. -->

### ⚠️ AGENT ROUTING CHECKLIST (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY CODE/DESIGN RESPONSE)

**Before ANY code or design work, you MUST complete this mental checklist:**

| Step | Check                                                    | If Unchecked                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Did I identify the correct agent for this domain?        | → STOP. Analyze request domain first.        |
| 2    | Did I READ the agent's `.md` file (or recall its rules)? | → STOP. Open `.agent/agents/{agent}.md`      |
| 3    | Did I announce agent + skills?                           | → STOP. Add announcement before response.    |
| 4    | Did I load required skills from agent's frontmatter?     | → STOP. Check `skills:` field and read them. |

**Failure Conditions:**

- ❌ Writing code without identifying an agent = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
- ❌ Skipping the announcement = **USER CANNOT VERIFY AGENT WAS USED**
- ❌ Ignoring agent-specific rules (e.g., Purple Ban) = **QUALITY FAILURE**

> 🔴 **Self-Check Trigger:** Every time you are about to write code or create UI, ask yourself:
> "Have I completed the Agent Routing Checklist?" If NO → Complete it first.

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**

- Agents: `.agent/` (Project)
- Skills: `.agent/skills/` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: `.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/`

### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

```
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
```

**Before coding, answer:**

1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?
